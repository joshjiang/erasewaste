# erasewaste
UNC COMP 433 Android Programming: Final Project
Erase Waste is an android app that tackles the issue of food waste and over-consumption of new goods. It allows participants to contribute to free-item-community through redirecting consumerism into the reuse stream. Users simply have to take a picture of a reusable item, for example, an old couch on the curb or an unfinished platter of catered campus food, and upload it to the app. As an option, users can provide descriptions, tags and signatures to the photo. The app will automatically associate a location with the item and place it into a sorted feed. Other users can then scroll through the feed to shop for items that they want and find them on the map.
